This experience allowed me to grow as a teacher, as an entrepreuner but above all as a motivational speaker.

Always hungry to learn and expand his musical knowledge he studied under some of the foremost teachers at the time. \n\nHe spent the 80s honing not only his performance and technical skills but also his teaching abilities.\n\nAs well as performing in various rock bands he started teaching in various schools and academies including Kent County Schools where he was employed as their first contemporary music instructor for the guitar.\n\nIn the late 80s he relocated to London, working in recording studios recording and doing session work during the daytime and playing live in the numerous bars and clubs in the evenings. He also set up his own private teaching company. As his experience working in studios grew he began to record music for advertising and marketing companies, and small radio stations. As well as his teaching role he worked as a session musician recording music for record companies including Virgin Records and Acid Jazz.\n\nIn the 90s he made the bold step of moving to Florida. Where he focused on teaching, working privately and also in schools in the Orlando region. During that time, he was lucky to meet some great musicians that encouraged him to continue his own personal studies and grow his musical knowledge.\n\nAs one who loves to travel and see new places he decided that his next stop would be Panama. A great place to learn Jazz and amazing Latin Rhythm. He really enjoyed his time down there and worked some wonderful bars and clubs. It felt like everyone wanted to learn to play the guitar, young and old.\n\nNext stop was Dubai. Here he focused 100% on teaching. It was actually in Dubai that he started offering Skype Guitar lessons to students based in the Middle East, now he spends more time in front of a computer than he does in the classroom. His love for teaching and exploring new technology means he can bring new and interesting ideas to his lessons.","firstName":"Geoff","lastName":"Sinker","photo":{"id":"ecd46d5a-c4a2-4c39-acae-64b8b5d7ed0b","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscription":{"subscribed":false,"pending":false},"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"8f6c4986-fa70-412a-8e83-3761af6c900c","type":"3

","specialistOverview":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Katrina. I have lived studied and worked in the UK for 20 years. I used to be a college lecturer, specialised in adult Autism. I am now back on my home territory of Malaysian Borneo, where I run and own a stress management centre, called 'Whole Life Stress Management'. The aim of my centre is to help people gain better health and control over their lives. At my studio I help individuals on a 121 basis get control over their challenges. This could be helping people manage their weight, conquer physical pain, anxiety and depression. I have an MA in adult autism, that relates to anxiety, and I have also derived a course particularly for that in mind. Through experience, I have found most people's problems relate to the stress they endure in this modern world we live in. I have therefore decided to create courses of what I do at my centre, online so that it is opened to the rest of the world to access. My courses concentrate on approaching health, wellness, weight loss and youthfulness as well as conquering one's own authenticity and gaining independence through the art of stress management. It's all about conquering challenging emotions before considering food and lifestyle choices. It's a different approach to mental and physical health that deals with our challenges with kindness, love and patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy consultations are for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdult High Functioning Autism - Work/Life Strategies and Stress Management\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor others: Kundalini Yoga Sessions (As part of the consultation)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeditation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStress Management strategies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealthy Eating for weight loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to lose weight intuitively\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am now in the UK. \u0026nbsp;I help people heal through chakra clearing Kundalini yoga, particularly if you have suffered from trauma of some sort. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","firstName":"Katrina","lastName":"Zawawi","photo":{"id":"f94fca60-32c2-4065-b299-b3428c578a78","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscription":{"subscribed":false,"pending":false},"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"9c20a951-2ded-45a5-85d5-11328ccfd7be","type":"3 months","typeName":"THREE_MONTH","amountValue":101.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":3,"order":20,"noSavings":false},{"id":"b3a8c246-7f74-4473-9e2c-e3b0b91c505e","type":"12 months","typeName":"TWELVE_MONTH","amountValue":551.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":12,"order":40,"noSavings":false},{"id":"06604f95-32e6-42b7-bd6d-b66171949024","type":"1 month","typeName":"ONE_MONTH","amountValue":51.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":1,"order":10,"preferred":true,"noSavings":false}]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":21412,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":659,"countAttachments":0,"totalDurationHours":6.13},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"FAILED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60c09257573d8600012056fa","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"subscribed":false,"enrolled":false,"badges":[],"purchaseOnly":false,"usePercentage":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","accountId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","slug":"lose-weight-and-get-into-shape-intuitively","topicIds":["7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7"],"subTopicIds":["f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":1683.5,"rating":5,"rate":99.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7","name":"Health \u0026 Fitness"},"subTopics":[{"id":"f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e","name":"Fitness"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":8633,"CLICK":248,"VIEW":2851,"FEED":16207,"PURCHASE":1,"LESSON_FINISHED":2},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Katrina Zawawi","courseName":"Lose Weight and get into shape intuitively","courseDescription":"\u003cp\u003eThis weight/fat loss course works because many diets and strict exercise regimes don't.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt works on the principle that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Everyone is determined to begin with, but then the rebellious human nature kicks in during a diet/weight loss programme, even if you are succeeding on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*I have been on so many diet/exercise regimes and I always manage to gain the weight/fat again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrictness = \u0026nbsp;rebelliousness, after a while. \u0026nbsp;Does this sound familiar to you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Worrying about dieting and weight loss itself brings all kinds of stress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStress hormones can make you fat and retain the weight you have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Many exercise regimes don't take into account how the body may feel fatigued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if your body doesn't feel fatigued, emotionally, you may do - and this can have an impact on weight loss progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Following programmes can be tedious and take so much time out of our days, that we dedicate all of our energies to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Being on a diet can make us really moody and not fun to be around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*A drastic change, like a dietary programme and exercise regime can take an emotional toll on the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes this all resonate with your experiences of trying to lose weight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Your'e probably wondering, what makes this programme so different. \u0026nbsp;Well, it's easy really!.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, I have created a course where:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1.

Always hungry to learn and expand his musical knowledge he studied under some of the foremost teachers at the time. \n\nHe spent the 80s honing not only his performance and technical skills but also his teaching abilities.\n\nAs well as performing in various rock bands he started teaching in various schools and academies including Kent County Schools where he was employed as their first contemporary music instructor for the guitar.\n\nIn the late 80s he relocated to London, working in recording studios recording and doing session work during the daytime and playing live in the numerous bars and clubs in the evenings. He also set up his own private teaching company. As his experience working in studios grew he began to record music for advertising and marketing companies, and small radio stations. As well as his teaching role he worked as a session musician recording music for record companies including Virgin Records and Acid Jazz.\n\nIn the 90s he made the bold step of moving to Florida. Where he focused on teaching, working privately and also in schools in the Orlando region. During that time, he was lucky to meet some great musicians that encouraged him to continue his own personal studies and grow his musical knowledge.\n\nAs one who loves to travel and see new places he decided that his next stop would be Panama. A great place to learn Jazz and amazing Latin Rhythm. He really enjoyed his time down there and worked some wonderful bars and clubs. It felt like everyone wanted to learn to play the guitar, young and old.\n\nNext stop was Dubai. Here he focused 100% on teaching. It was actually in Dubai that he started offering Skype Guitar lessons to students based in the Middle East, now he spends more time in front of a computer than he does in the classroom.

This makes the pentatonic scales a really good starting point for getting into creative popular-styles keyboard playing – which is what \u0026nbsp;the Musicarta Pentatonics Workbook offers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are optional and comprehensive theory modules for reference with hard copy downloads, plus progressive keyboard drills to help you work through the \u0026nbsp;build-up of the major and minor pentatonic scales in all keys yourself, with full video support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut mostly, the emphasis is on getting some real, attractive pentatonic music into the collection of pieces you can just play - pieces which illustrate whatever 'theory' we;re looking at - and teaching them in a way that gives you real creative keyboard skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatch the introductory video for some examples, like the minor pentatonic One-Octave Blues - up and down the minor pentatonic scale in three places – nice, easy all-white-keys for beginners, every step demonstrated and how to practice it. You can't go wrong!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe major pentatonic scale is demonstrated with another characteristic showpiece which is worth your while mastering for its stylistic building blocks even if the style is not quite your 'cup of tea'.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusicarta is the field leader in coaching the syncopation in these typical popular style pieces: what to practice, how to practice it, and video demonstrations to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen on to the characteristic additional semitones which you'll find in the pentatonic scales, both major and minor, and which you're going to want to know about to flesh out your melodies and improvisations, and to hone your playing-by-ear skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new resources are demonstrated with pieces which build on what you already know, so you actually hear the new options you're acquiring. And as you learn more notes, you get more options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMix'n'Match Blues is an exercise in playing by ear which also invites you to exercise your musical judgement and craft your own arrangement from a selection of possibilities. Composing at the keyboard, we call it here at Musicarta - sort of slow-motion improvisation, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of their simplified, five-note structure, the pentatonic scales are a great entry point for 'playing by ear'. It's really not much of an exaggeration to say that most of the popular music melody you hear is mostly pentatonic, so if you can find the major and minor pentatonic scale-tones on the keyboard – which, if you work through this course, you will be able to – you'll be way ahead of the game in terms of picking popular music melodies out at the keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur playing-by-ear module uses 'logical melodies' to give you more of a fighting chance, and progressive exercises, through increasingly so-called 'difficult' keys, which will leave you essentially \"knowing what the keyboard sounds like\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd whether you're working on other people's material or playing your own, isn't that just what you want to know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so to improvisation. The simplicity and familiarity of the pentatonic scales, together with their 'no wrong notes' properties, makes them great for first steps in improvising. \u0026nbsp;Blues improvisation is nearly all purely pentatonic, usually minor. Piano blues is a whole genre in itself, of course, but even with just the basics, you'll have that blues sound down, and you can get a nice two-handed groove going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve-bar pentatonic blues riffs get your mojo working - and what's music without mojo? Soaring major pentatonic soloing is also massively productive in terms of effect from resources. Running up and down well-chosen fragments of the five-note major pentatonic scale easily generates great emotional impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we all have to practice. Not just running up and down scales - even pentatonic scales.

This makes the pentatonic scales a really good starting point for getting into creative popular-styles keyboard playing – which is what \u0026nbsp;the Musicarta Pentatonics Workbook offers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are optional and comprehensive theory modules for reference with hard copy downloads, plus progressive keyboard drills to help you work through the \u0026nbsp;build-up of the major and minor pentatonic scales in all keys yourself, with full video support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut mostly, the emphasis is on getting some real, attractive pentatonic music into the collection of pieces you can just play - pieces which illustrate whatever 'theory' we;re looking at - and teaching them in a way that gives you real creative keyboard skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatch the introductory video for some examples, like the minor pentatonic One-Octave Blues - up and down the minor pentatonic scale in three places – nice, easy all-white-keys for beginners, every step demonstrated and how to practice it. You can't go wrong!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe major pentatonic scale is demonstrated with another characteristic showpiece which is worth your while mastering for its stylistic building blocks even if the style is not quite your 'cup of tea'.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusicarta is the field leader in coaching the syncopation in these typical popular style pieces: what to practice, how to practice it, and video demonstrations to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen on to the characteristic additional semitones which you'll find in the pentatonic scales, both major and minor, and which you're going to want to know about to flesh out your melodies and improvisations, and to hone your playing-by-ear skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new resources are demonstrated with pieces which build on what you already know, so you actually hear the new options you're acquiring. And as you learn more notes, you get more options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMix'n'Match Blues is an exercise in playing by ear which also invites you to exercise your musical judgement and craft your own arrangement from a selection of possibilities. Composing at the keyboard, we call it here at Musicarta - sort of slow-motion improvisation, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of their simplified, five-note structure, the pentatonic scales are a great entry point for 'playing by ear'. It's really not much of an exaggeration to say that most of the popular music melody you hear is mostly pentatonic, so if you can find the major and minor pentatonic scale-tones on the keyboard – which, if you work through this course, you will be able to – you'll be way ahead of the game in terms of picking popular music melodies out at the keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur playing-by-ear module uses 'logical melodies' to give you more of a fighting chance, and progressive exercises, through increasingly so-called 'difficult' keys, which will leave you essentially \"knowing what the keyboard sounds like\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd whether you're working on other people's material or playing your own, isn't that just what you want to know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so to improvisation. The simplicity and familiarity of the pentatonic scales, together with their 'no wrong notes' properties, makes them great for first steps in improvising. \u0026nbsp;Blues improvisation is nearly all purely pentatonic, usually minor. Piano blues is a whole genre in itself, of course, but even with just the basics, you'll have that blues sound down, and you can get a nice two-handed groove going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve-bar pentatonic blues riffs get your mojo working - and what's music without mojo? Soaring major pentatonic soloing is also massively productive in terms of effect from resources. Running up and down well-chosen fragments of the five-note major pentatonic scale easily generates great emotional impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we all have to practice. Not just running up and down scales - even pentatonic scales. More like pentatonic scale-tone patterns, which are 'practically music already' \u0026nbsp;patterns - you're soloing without knowing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Musicarta Pentatonics Workbook has enough practice patterns to keep you going for a year, which will teach you how to find the music you want to play and coach you in getting your fingers round the keys.

Always hungry to learn and expand his musical knowledge he studied under some of the foremost teachers at the time. \n\nHe spent the 80s honing not only his performance and technical skills but also his teaching abilities.\n\nAs well as performing in various rock bands he started teaching in various schools and academies including Kent County Schools where he was employed as their first contemporary music instructor for the guitar.\n\nIn the late 80s he relocated to London, working in recording studios recording and doing session work during the daytime and playing live in the numerous bars and clubs in the evenings. He also set up his own private teaching company. As his experience working in studios grew he began to record music for advertising and marketing companies, and small radio stations. As well as his teaching role he worked as a session musician recording music for record companies including Virgin Records and Acid Jazz.\n\nIn the 90s he made the bold step of moving to Florida. Where he focused on teaching, working privately and also in schools in the Orlando region. During that time, he was lucky to meet some great musicians that encouraged him to continue his own personal studies and grow his musical knowledge.\n\nAs one who loves to travel and see new places he decided that his next stop would be Panama. A great place to learn Jazz and amazing Latin Rhythm. He really enjoyed his time down there and worked some wonderful bars and clubs. It felt like everyone wanted to learn to play the guitar, young and old.\n\nNext stop was Dubai. Here he focused 100% on teaching. It was actually in Dubai that he started offering Skype Guitar lessons to students based in the Middle East, now he spends more time in front of a computer than he does in the classroom. His love for teaching and exploring new technology means he can bring new and interesting ideas to his lessons.","firstName":"Geoff","lastName":"Sinker","photo":{"id":"ecd46d5a-c4a2-4c39-acae-64b8b5d7ed0b","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscription":{"subscribed":false,"pending":false},"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"8f6c4986-fa70-412a-8e83-3761af6c900c","type":"3 months","typeName":"THREE_MONTH","trialInterval":"DAY","trialIntervalCount":1,"amountValue":61.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":3,"order":20,"noSavings":false},{"id":"7d476573-1727-4a2c-ab62-16f7170f3dcb","type":"1 month","typeName":"ONE_MONTH","trialInterval":"DAY","trialIntervalCount":1,"amountValue":26.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":1,"order":10,"noSavings":false},{"id":"eaea0ac4-2a0a-4133-9ea9-c454006b7b7a","type":"1 week","typeName":"ONE_WEEK","trialInterval":"DAY","trialIntervalCount":1,"amountValue":9.99,"interval":"WEEK","intervalCount":1,"order":1,"preferred":true,"noSavings":false}]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":8101,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":476,"countAttachments":0,"totalDurationHours":2.38},"subtitles":{"transcription":{"language":"en","mode":"AUTO","status":"COMPLETED"}},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[{"file":"88a506c1-d0ef-4097-99d1-c8965833373a"},{"file":"b0507cc1-35e5-4e95-88a6-6bbc1e997ae3"},{"file":"f6c81329-49d3-49b3-b964-87eec60e46e0"}]},"fileReplication":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"subtitlesLangs":[{"id":"60c09257573d8600012056fa","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"}],"language":{"id":"60c09257573d8600012056fa","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"subscribed":false,"enrolled":false,"badges":[],"purchaseOnly":false,"usePercentage":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"d3bc22d8-9517-4608-ac01-d1c8f0d614ba","accountId":"d3bc22d8-9517-4608-ac01-d1c8f0d614ba","slug":"introduction-to-guitar-pro-7-music-notation-software","topicIds":["5408f13c-8542-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa"],"subTopicIds":["5408f13c-8542-9bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":398.5,"rating":5,"rate":0,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"5408f13c-8542-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa","name":"Music"},"subTopics":[{"id":"5408f13c-8542-9bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa","name":"Music Software"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":5457,"CLICK":12,"VIEW":453,"FEED":28,"PURCHASE":16,"LESSON_FINISHED":34,"COURSE_FINISHED":1},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Geoff Sinker","courseName":"Introduction To Guitar Pro 7 Music Notation Software","courseDescription":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to my course Introduction to Guitar Pro 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is Geoff Sinker and I am a Musician, Editor and Teacher with over 30 years experience.
